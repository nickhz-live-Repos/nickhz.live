                                    I greet the universe today! <img src="img/journal/diary/ringed-blue-planet.gif" alt="a pure-blue planet with a ring around it" />

                                    This diary that looks like an actual 
                                    diary is a bit of an experiment. It's 
                                    just a prototype right now, but I 
                                    think I'd like to share the format so 
                                    others can have their own webpage 
                                    diaries, too! That's getting ahead of 
                                    myself, though. Or maybe it's just 
                                    straight to the point...
                                </p>
                                
                                <p>
                                    The Web can be a medium of free 
                                    expression, and I want to share that 
                                    with others. It can be fun and 
                                    creative and authentic, it can respect 
                                    the amount of time & attention you 
                                    have, and all parts of it don't have 
                                    to descend into an adware sellout 
                                    culture. I want to share the means to 
                                    pursue a more human vision of the Web 
                                    with others, and I want to do it 
                                    full-time.
                                </p>
                                
                                <p>
                                    I will likely quit my 4-year job with 
                                    Infosys soon. I learned that I've been 
                                    paid much less than my real worth for 
                                    the work I've done. The people there 
                                    have treated me well enough, but I'm 
                                    already looking at what comes after. 
                                    And that doesn't just mean 
                                    higher-paying jobs. The way I see it, 
                                    I have three options for how I'll make 
                                    ends meet without throwing everything 
                                    away:

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            Make & foster my own 
                                            creations that'll support 
                                            me financially. Low financial 
                                            certainty, high freedom. I'd 
                                            prefer this, and it has  
                                            potential for me to focus my 
                                            energy on something that makes 
                                            the world a little better. 
                                            Meaningful work.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Freelance project commissions. 
                                            Below average financial 
                                            certainty, above average 
                                            freedom. I may do this if my 
                                            own projects aren't panning 
                                            out. Potentially stimulating & 
                                            diverse.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Another job. Financially 
                                            certain, not very freeing. If 
                                            the above aren't working or if 
                                            I need to pay into something 
                                            important, I'll put my plans on 
                                            hold & sell my time to pay 
                                            for what matters. Good pay.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </p>
                                    
                                <p>
                                    In any case, it's best that I continue 
                                    working on things beyond any 
                                    employment. All these options 
                                    benefit from expanded & up-to-date 
                                    software skills. I've been working on 
                                    this site for the better part of the 
                                    last week now, so it's what's going on in 
                                    my life. I plan on making subdomains that 
                                    use different technology stacks, too, so 
                                    it'll expand my horizons when it comes to 
                                    creating & learning more. Practicing the 
                                    discipline to work full-time without being 
                                    told to... that's one of the big steps to 
                                    getting where I want to go.
                                    <br />
                                    A giant leap toward a great 
                                    journey!

                                <p>
                                    I don't really have a New Year's 
                                    resolution, but ramping up my work here 
                                    feels like the kind of change that 
                                    can count as one! it's partly just a 
                                    coincidence that I start now, and I say 
                                    "partly" because the turn of the new 
                                    year is exactly when I was offboarded from 
                                    the <small>enterprise</small> project I 
                                    was working on for Truist under Infosys. 
                                    I didn't do anything wrong, they just cut 
                                    funding from the whole project and let 
                                    everyone go, effective January 1st. Things 
                                    were uncertain for a lot of my teammates, 
                                    but I at least have some sort of plan. 
                                    Albeit, lots of people wouldn't want to 
                                    try what I'm trying, to start working on 
                                    my own Web projects and shoot for the moon.
                                </p>

                                    Curiosity is my great motivator in life. 
                                    I can find fulfillment in getting better 
                                    at the things I can do, as well as in 
                                    learning the things that I can't. I like 
                                    to imagine something and then research & 
                                    measure & experiment & build & fix up 
                                    mistakes & finally bring it to life. It's 
                                    part of what motivated me into STEM, and 
                                    mechanical engineering seemed to have the 
                                    widest available paths forward.  Sure 
                                    enough, after I got my bachelor of science 
                                    in mechanical engineering from Georgia 
                                    Tech, I picked up skills across several 
                                    other fields of study & practice. From 
                                    electronics & controls to communications 
                                    & management, I've welded and drafted and 
                                    supervised and wired things up and... 
                                    programmed software.

                                    I learned basic Java early on in my 
                                    education and enjoyed it so much that 
                                    <a href="https://github.com/Hernandezn/IntroToJava2013" target="_blank">I

                                    before the semester was halfway through. I 
                                    figured I didn't need to pay a college to 
                                    learn something I already enjoy.

                                    I was a weird kid growing up, not 
                                    for being maladjusted or anything, since I 
                                    was popular enough at school and had 
                                    oddities that were just as likely to 
                                    become trends. Rather, I just wasn't 
                                    very concerned with people's opinions of 
                                    me, so I would say and do things that were 
                                    spontaneous. The professional world seeks 
                                    to crush this.
                                    In my view, the only ones whose opinions 
                                    of you matter in life are those you love 
                                    and those you work for. Ideally, you're in 
                                    both of those groups, but for most of us, 
                                    when we first start working, we need 
                                    someone else to work for so we can have a 
                                    direction to move toward. The employer's 
                                    opinion of you determines your fate. You 
                                    must be "professional," not 
                                    just in terms of your ability, but in 
                                    terms of your culture. Your behavior, your

                                    I've honestly wanted to make this sort of 
                                    change for a long time now, and it's a lot 
                                    of my desires all coming together. It took 
                                    its rough shape when I created my 
                                    first Neocities website, but that's 
                                    only a piece of where this plan comes 
                                    from. I grew up not wanting to care what 
                                    people think and had to compromise on that 
                                    when the opinions of people in the 
                                    professional world determined if I could 
                                    put food on the table. I had to make the 
                                    regular taken-for-granted compromises of 
                                    what I could work on, when I could work, 
                                    how much I could get compensated, who has 
                                    control, how I dress, just a lot of things 
                                    that are normal if you want to be 
                                    employed. That's just how it is, and you 
                                    deal with it.
                                </p>

                                    However. If you work harder, it doesn't 
                                    mean you get paid more. If you're a better 
                                    worker, they just give you more work. And 
                                    I've learned that I work particularly 
                                    hard. The owner benefits, and that doesn't 
                                    necessarily mean you do. This isn't a 
                                    knock on capitalism; I do think it's 
                                    valuable to be able to make 
                                    tradeoffs to offload the otherwise 
                                    complicated problem of justifying the 
                                    benefits you take from society. Rather, 
                                    it's to ask: what would it take for me to 
                                    become an owner and benefit from my work?
                                </p>

                                    Well, I need to be willing to work 
                                    without being told. I feel this already 
                                    filters out many of us, including my past 
                                    self. I need a vision for creating 
                                    something that might make people's lives a 
                                    little better. I need several hard and 
                                    soft skills: to be able to make 
                                    complicated decisions, think on my feet, 
                                    live below my means, deal with mistakes, 
                                    communicate effectively, stick to my 
                                    commitments... so many little things I at 
                                    least partly have my employment to thank 
                                    for. And I think that now, at the start of 
                                    2025, I'm finally ready :)

                                <p>
                                    I added a cool little visual effect to the 
                                    homepage!
                                </p>

                                    I call it "Virtual Particles," and it's  
                                    inspired by the real-life(ish) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_particle" target="_blank">virtual 
                                    particles</a> used in physics to model 
                                    force interactions using particles as 
                                    force carriers! I've done my fair share of 
                                    physics-ing by now, but it's still a 
                                    darling subject for me. The visual effect 
                                    has little to do with actual virtual 
                                    particles, though; it's just what I 
                                    imagine some of them might look a bit like 
                                    if you could see them. They suddenly & 
                                    quietly pop into existence, they say "hey, 
                                    can't stop for tea," they travel a short 
                                    distance, then they disappear just as 
                                    suddenly as they appeared.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    It's really just a visual effect meant to 
                                    look cool, and it didn't take that long to 
                                    make, either! That makes me surprised that 
                                    I hardly ever see anyone else do anything 
                                    quite like it, even on the wild & creative 
                                    side of the Web. Big business would never 
                                    have me work on something so frivolous, 
                                    but I think that it makes the homepage 
                                    look more alive. It's Alive Internet 
                                    Theory!

                                    Because of the way I make this site as a 
                                    sort of art & experimentation project, it 
                                    makes it subject to a type of writer's 
                                    block. How should the next page look & 
                                    interact? Should I use a page I already 
                                    made as the template for the next one?

                                    I'm looking at making another journal 
                                    entry, and I don't think I want it to 
                                    operate the way this diary does. The 
                                    experience of a book-like page is cool and 
                                    all, but compared to a more standard 
                                    single-column continuous webpage, the 
                                    small-book format is inconvenient if you 
                                    want to convey information that would be 
                                    useful to have others read. This diary is 
                                    more of a personal tool, for me to write 
                                    down & solidify some of my thoughts, 
                                    plans, ideas, or what have you. It's not 
                                    necessarily meant to reach any audience of 
                                    readers.

                                    But if I'm making a journal volume to 
                                    better document my creation of this site 
                                    or other projects, or to showcase 
                                    others' works, or to show how to do 
                                    something from my own experience, that 
                                    could be useful to share with people. 
                                    And it's just more easily engaged with in 
                                    a more standard familiar non-page-turney 
                                    format. Without any intrusive ads. So 
                                    many informational pages let themselves be

                                    In the USA, there's currently fire to the 
                                    west and ice to the east. Wildfires and 
                                    snowstorms. For all the tragedy that 
                                    follows, the very concept of it is 
                                    evocative. Many a creator and thinker must 
                                    be pondering right now. It's a time of 
                                    change for a lot of people, willing or

                                    thinking of some of my goals. My most 
                                    impressive projects right now are under a 
                                    pseudonym, but I don't want to publicly 
                                    associate these projects with my real 
                                    name. These other projects wouldn't be 
                                    stains on my professional presentation or 
                                    indicative of a direction that I don't 
                                    want to follow. Instead, I think of the 
                                    potential futures of having one project or 
                                    another under this name or that one or 
                                    both, and I prefer the futures where these 
                                    names are separated, at least for a while.

                                    I want to be able to work on eclectic 
                                    passion projects that I might not 
                                    complete, without the pressure of 
                                    professional scrutiny. I also want to be 
                                    able to work on more professionally 
                                    inclined projects without associating them 
                                    with my most precious fun & creative 
                                    endeavors. I have a right to be at least a 
                                    little bit concerned about my own privacy 
                                    and the privacy of people I've associated 
                                    with under a username, and I don't want 
                                    real-life professional associates to be 
                                    able to exercise power over communities or 
                                    projects that I might create under this 
                                    other persona. Plus, associating these two 
                                    names is an irreversible process.

                                    It's not like that's unheard of in this 
                                    space, either. I've had the UI component 
                                    library 
                                    <a href="https://ui.shadcn.com/" target="blank">ShadCN/UI</a> 
                                    on my radar for a bit, and while 
                                    <a href="https://shadcn.com/" target="blank">the 
                                    developer of the library</a> might have 
                                    their real government name floating out 
                                    there somewhere, they haven't made its 
                                    association with the "shadcn" name obvious 
                                    in any way. I can't speak on their 
                                    motivations for this, but if I was to do 
                                    this, it would be because I prefer that my 
                                    creations come first and that personal 
                                    real-life recognition for it is an 
                                    afterthought, if even thought of at all. 
                                    It makes the idea of using all of my 
                                    personal creations as resume builders 
                                    taste bitter on my tongue. Blegh!

                                    elsewhere.

                                    think having a professional presentation 
                                    like this would be unbecoming of this 
                                    other persona. Under this other name, I 
                                    hail the values of

                                    creative freedom. If I do that while

                                    enterprise projects, it feels like a 
                                    compromise of what I want to build under 
                                    that other name.

                                    However, an employer is necessary to the 
                                    life of most Americans, and a site with my 
                                    real government name on it is necessary if 
                                    I want to use it to host a Web page

                                    portfolio for an employer, but just a 
                                    couple pages ago, I was questioning the 
                                    idea of myself in particular even needing 
                                    an employer. However, the other big option 
                                    of creating my own applications to support 
                                    me has a sizeable risk of failure, and if 
                                    I can't get it to work out before my 
                                    savings look too uneasy, I'll have to go 
                                    back to an employer with either my best 
                                    projects associated with me or a big gap 
                                    in my resume.

                                    Last "night," I went to sleep at 11 in the 
                                    morning. I spent most of the night 
                                    re-tracing & documenting everything I did 
                                    to put this website online, just so I 
                                    could complete 
                                    <a href="journal/devlog/1" target="_blank">my 
                                    first development log</a>. Like I say at 
                                    the end of that document, I'm hoping that 
                                    having done that saves me the stress of 
                                    figuring it out again in the future. 
                                    Making that document was the most stress 
                                    I've put on myself for the entire 
                                    development of the site, though a lot of 
                                    that is because I was dead tired by the 
                                    end of it. Everyone I've worked with knows 
                                    I work hard, but this time, I did it my 
                                    way. And unlike 
                                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQzdAsjWGPg" target="_blank">the

                                    So what's next? Thus far, a lot of what 
                                    I've put on this site has just been 
                                    logistical stuff with my own little coat 
                                    of paint on it. I think of the home page 
                                    as an atrium, which is part of what 
                                    inspires its look, with the lights from 
                                    above but something clean & airy within. 
                                    True to an atrium, it has doors to all 
                                    the other places. The WIP page helps me 
                                    keep track of things I want to work on 
                                    next, the Resume page is a layer of 
                                    personal financial security for me in case 
                                    I need to go back to that lifestyle, and 
                                    the Journal page is a context where I can 
                                    couch things that I want to have written 
                                    down somewhere.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    I think the next thing I make for ths site 
                                    will be a sort of context, too. I've been 
                                    eying up 
                                    <a href="https://eloquentjavascript.net/" target="_blank">this 
                                    online textbook on JavaScript</a>, and 
                                    having pages where I noodle out the 
                                    concepts from the textbook could be nicer 
                                    than just writing some scripts and leaving 
                                    them in folders that no one ever looks at 
                                    again. And I may make a links page sooner 
                                    rather than later, just to start it off 
                                    with links to resources like this.

                                    I looked at the costs 
                                    for all this, and though the monthly cost 
                                    is pretty comfortable at under 15 monthly 
                                    (which is largely just Amazon's firewall 
                                    service), I still think it's not all that 
                                    worth it if someone JUST wants a static 
                                    site, at least compared to free services 
                                    like Neocities or even paid ones like 
                                    Namecheap. Just, if you want to eventually 
                                    expand it into some bigger ecosystem that 
                                    has custom fullstack Web applications or 
                                    proper CI/CD with version control or 
                                    scalable infrastructure, things that are 
                                    important to a lot of projects that aspire 
                                    to provide something useful for a lot of 
                                    people, learning AWS is probably the 
                                    better investment. Plus, it's harder than 
                                    all those other things, very much more manual.

                                    Standard Web design like that can 
                                    be great for maintainability and having 
                                    multiple teammates understand it quickly 
                                    to work on it continuousy. However, on a 
                                    one-person site like this that serves as a

                                    like that would constrain my exploration

                                    So now, I have a Professional Development 
                                    index. I was driven to do it by wanting a 
                                    page to track my continued self-education 
                                    & skills development and trying to figure 
                                    out where that page should go. Well, now 
                                    it'll go on one of the petals on the 
                                    Professional Development page, right 
                                    alongside the Resume. Then, when I make 
                                    the subpage tracking my self-education and 
                                    link it on the Professional Development 
                                    index, I can have a proper place to record 
                                    my work from the 
                                    <a href="https://eloquentjavascript.net/" target="_blank">JavaScript 
                                    textbook</a> I mentioned in yesterday's 
                                    diary entry. Having skimmed the book now, 
                                    I'm not sure it'll be the most useful for 
                                    me at my level, but it's encouraged me to 
                                    build pages to support my wider goals! 
                                    Though, I think I'd also like to track my 
                                    progress in other pursuits, like fitness, 
                                    cooking, and music production. I'll 
                                    probably just put those elsewhere, maybe 
                                    link a "hobbies" page on my self-education 
                                    / skills pages.

                                    I looked up "the color of knowledge" to 
                                    get an idea of a color I might want to 
                                    build around for a self-education page, 
                                    and the search results had a consensus on 
                                    blue or navy. But beyond that, black (the 
                                    color of my resume page & this diary) was 
                                    identified as a "career" or "life path" 
                                    color, while white & gray (the color of my 
                                    homepage) are associated with 
                                    "creativity," "helpfulness," and "heaven" 
                                    in feng shui. I've previously made all 
                                    these same associations with the pages on 
                                    this site that have the corresponding 
                                    colors, and that was completely 
                                    unintended!
                                </p>

                                    Aside from all that, I think my sleep is 
                                    going back to normal now. Instead of 
                                    falling asleep at 11 AM, 11 AM is when I 
                                    woke up this morning! And now, I'm feeling 
                                    sleepy before even getting to 10 PM. I 
                                    thought I'd be on gremlin time for at 
                                    least a few more days, but my body just 
                                    wants to self-correct. Not that I'm 
                                    complaining. Hopefully, it means I can get 
                                    a normal night's rest.

                                    I've been absent from this diary for 
                                    several days! I created the 
                                    <a href="professional/self-development" target="_blank">professional 
                                    self-development page</a> in parts & 
                                    filling out entries for the page before 
                                    starting to read 
                                    <a href="https://eloquentjavascript.net/" target="_blank">the 
                                    JavaScript textbook I'd been eying</a>. 
                                    It turned out there were a lot of notes to 
                                    take, so I also created 
                                    <a href="professional/self-development/eloquent-javascript-2024" target="_blank">a 
                                    self-study page</a> to help me track my 
                                    progress through the book.

                                    Reading that textbook has been taking up a 
                                    lot of the development time I use for the 
                                    site, so last week's Git commits look 
                                    a lot weaker than the amount of time I've 
                                    been putting in! There's been a daily 
                                    chapter of notes for several days now, but 
                                    in the meantime, I've been contacted by a 
                                    recruiter offering good pay. I've stated 
                                    on this site before that I plan on using 
                                    subdomains to hold other technology stacks 
                                    like React JS & Java Spring, and the 
                                    recruiter's interest in React is making me 
                                    double down on that.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    However, now that I've gone back to the 
                                    React documentation to prep for review, it 
                                    looks like ever since my React projects in 
                                    2020 & 2021, there have been big changes 
                                    to how React works. They're heavily 
                                    pushing using React on the backend, and 
                                    there are a lot of things wrong with using 
                                    JavaScript as your server technology. 
                                    There hasn't been a new 
                                    <code>create-react-app</code> release 
                                    since 2022, so pure-frontend React either 
                                    has to be built from a slow-running 
                                    collection of script loaders or from a 
                                    third-party tool like Vite. It's no wonder 
                                    I hear so much complaint from people in 
                                    software about server-side JavaScript. 
                                    I'd understand if it was just the 
                                    recommended option to use server-side 
                                    React, but to make it nigh mandatory is 
                                    definite grounds for people to start 
                                    turning their backs on it.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    When I start working with React again, I  
                                    plan on using Vite. That way, I can use a 
                                    proper backend technology. Only after that 
                                    do I plan to go to the React-React stack

                                    But anyway, the infrastructure for back 
                                    end deployment is gonna be a task on its 
                                    own. I may write another self-tutorial dev 
                                    log just to document what I do, hopefully 
                                    get a good refresh on my understanding of 
                                    Docker & EC2s. I'll see if I can call its 
                                    API from these static pages, too.

                                    Right now, I'm going back to the 
                                    JavaScript book. The chapter on regular 
                                    expressions is one of the longest in the 
                                    book, but it's made of a lot of small 
                                    chunks. There'll be a lot of notes on that 
                                    one! <img src="img/journal/diary/notebook-with-pink-paper.png" alt="a notebook with pink paper" />

                                <p>
                                    I finished the JavaScript textbook! 
                                    <img src="img/journal/diary/javascript-logo-classic-style-icon-2.png" alt="a small javascript logo" />

                                    Now that that's done, I have a bunch of 
                                    new directions I can go in, plus a bunch 
                                    of old directions I can enrich. Between 
                                    my WIP page's TODOs, the JavaScript-based 
                                    frameworks, the potential backend 
                                    subdomain I can deploy with Node.JS now, 
                                    and making Web tools & modules that'll 
                                    help me accelerate my progress, it's 
                                    coming down on me that I should focus on 
                                    the tasks that bring me closer to my 
                                    goals. That textbook took weeks out of me, 
                                    and though going through a full 
                                    programming course on pure self-motivation 
                                    in a few weeks is probably nothing to 
                                    scoff at, I'm beyond the end of the first 
                                    month now and still only have this static 
                                    site to show for it. Maybe I'm holding 
                                    myself to a high standard on this, but I 
                                    think that's better than holding myself to 
                                    a low one.

                                    I wanted to deep-dive into other resources 
                                    like the famous C Programming textbook, 
                                    along with
                                    <a href="https://www.learncpp.com/" target="_blank">this 
                                    other online textbook offering an in-depth 
                                    course on C++</a>. I've also learned that 
                                    Node.JS is generally more performant than 
                                    my native Spring Boot, and Go is even more 
                                    performant than that. Also, PHP is 
                                    probably the most common requirement in 
                                    freelance work, and that uses C syntax.
                                </p>

                                    I'm curious about all of these, but if I 
                                    want assured safety for my future plans, I 
                                    have to ensure a properly lined up 
                                    fallback option. This might mean just 
                                    rushing to React, as that's getting the 
                                    most job recruiters to contact me. For 
                                    that, I want to be able to demonstrate 
                                    live React project work. And for that, I 
                                    want to have infrastructure that serves 
                                    it. That means CI/CD and EC2 work. 
                                </p>

                                    The ideal marketable skill set may be to 
                                    host a Spring Boot back end with Vite 
                                    React in the front. This means getting 
                                    back on proper footing with Spring Boot. 
                                    After I complete some housekeeping with 
                                    the site (and with a driver's license 
                                    renewal), I'll be diving back into Spring 
                                    Boot and getting my own API deployed. I'll 
                                    also need to review React, then
