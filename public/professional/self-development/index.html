                    <p>
                        In my first introduction to coding, I went beyond 
                        expectations for a fresh newbie and completed every 
                        exercise from a Java programming textbook. Coded using 
                        Notepad & JGrasp.

                        The course, only an elective in my physics / 
                        mechanical engineering curriculum, required a fraction 
                        of the work from the textbook. However, I was 
                        self-driven toward programming right when I discovered 
                        the craft, so I did much more than was required. The 
                        code I kept from this era is my receipt for having 
                        passion for this work from the beginning.

                        I read through & coded along with this entire textbook 
                        that covers JavaScript in both the browser and 
                        Node.JS. I refreshed & further contextualized concepts 
                        I was familiar with, learned several concepts I was 
                        unfamiliar with, and coded my own programs after every 
                        lesson. I have these programs to show in the 
                        "Exercises" subsections on the page linked here:

                    <p>
                        I created the above page to track my progress, to host 
                        my code, and to use the notes I took there as future 
                        reference material for myself.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I plan to use this refreshed knowledge as a 
                        springboard for further self-development projects, 
                        like:
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                self-study on JS-based Web frameworks like 
                                Angular and React / Next.JS
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                usage of my Node.JS practice as a vehicle to 
                                create live backend Web applications / APIs & 
                                have them deployed through a subdomain of this 
                                website, using EC2 infrastructure, 
                                CI/CD tools, and potentially Docker
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                exploration of loose ends from the book, such 
                                as websockets, SVG, higher HTTP versions, and 
                                the publication of my very own NPM packages
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        All in all, this is a worthwhile investment as a 
                        foundational work for future self-development. 
                        According to past teammates & coworkers, I was already 
                        particularly skilled with what JavaScript I knew, but 
                        with this formal deep dive, I unlock a more complete 
                        understanding of the many things that are built off of 
                        JavaScript, present and future.

                    <p>
                        This is my first proper self-contained product using 
                        only Node.JS without abstractions built on top of it. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The Live Filesystem is a basic live-hosted file 
                        explorer & file manager that's accessible through an 
                        also self-developed Web UI. It performs basic 
                        functions of system file explorers like Windows 
                        Explorer & Mac Finder, organizing the contents of a 
                        system-selected internal folder & its subfolders and 
                        allowing filesystem interactions from a live Web page. 
                        The Node server will serve the files from its attached 
                        filesystem when requested, and it also supports 
                        manipulation of the files & folders in the system.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        At the time of writing, it's a simple proof of concept 
                        for a self-authored Node.JS live Webapp with several 
                        request types & filesystem interactions, but it's 
                        entirely extensible and may serve as (at least 
                        intellectual) groundwork for my further work with 
                        Node.JS.
