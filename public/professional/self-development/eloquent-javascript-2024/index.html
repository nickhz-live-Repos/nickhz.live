                <p>
                    This is a self-study effort from January 2025. Scripts 
                    I wrote for the applicable chapter exercises are at the 
                    bottom of 
                    <a href="https://github.com/Hernandezn/nickhz.live/blob/main/public/professional/self-development/eloquent-javascript-2024/index.html" target="_blank">this 
                    page's source code</a>.
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    I've been eying this textbook for a few days now, but 
                    since I have this website, I figure this is a good place 
                    to host my notes in an environment where I can actually 
                    execute JavaScript. I didn't have a place to put it, 
                    though, so I changed my site structure to add 
                    <a href="../../" target="_blank">supporting</a> 
                    <a href="../?skill=html-css-js&praxis=eloquent-javascript-2024" target="_blank">pages</a> 
                    that lead to this one.
                </p>

                <p>
                    All this just to start studying? Yes. I enjoy the content 
                    of the work and the learning involved, plus an investment 
                    in myself pays dividends in the future. What kind of fool 
                    works without being told? One who's curious or creative or 
                    future focused or otherwise self-driven... that kind of 
                    fool! And now, I'll fool around with the content of this 
                    book.

                <blockquote>
                    "A sense of what a good program looks like is developed with practice, not learned from a list of rules."
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    This chapter discusses very basic concepts on the what & 
                    why of programming & JavaScript, so the part that shines 
                    out to me is the above quote. The author isn't teaching 
                    from a place of telling you what should be done, but 
                    rather from preparing you to tell <i>yourself</i> what 
                    should be done.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One who's not an artist doesn't know the rules. A good 
                    artist knows the rules well and follows them well. A great 
                    artist knows the rules well... and breaks them. Not by 
                    simply ignoring them, but by deconstructing the very 
                    reasons those rules exist.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The author and I share some values. That's what I've 
                    learned from this book's introduction.

                    That's not a bug, it's a feature.
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    This chapter had lots of basic operations, plus the 
                    nullish operator ("??"), which browsers didn't even widely 
                    support until 2020. I'm not sure a great number of people 
                    formally educated until just recently would even know 
                    about it if they're not doing occasional reviews of the 
                    base technology like I'm doing here. Even then, lots of 
                    documentation was made before this was well-supported. 
                    It's a case where the latest textbook edition is necessary 
                    if it's to supply this knowledge. Sure enough, 
                    <a href="https://eloquentjavascript.net/3rd_edition/01_values.html" target="_blank">this 
                    feature isn't in the same textbook's previous edition</a>. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    These are some concepts from this chapter that I haven't 
                    been using in my JavaScript:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code>2.998e8</code> // yields 299800000
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code><var>x</var> = <var>a</var> && <var>b</var>;</code> // "guard operator" where a is not boolean; only gives b if a is truthy, and gives back the falsey a otherwise
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code><var>x</var> = <var>a</var> || <var>b</var>;</code> // "default operator" where a is not boolean; gives a if it's truthy, and gives the default value b otherwise
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code><var>x</var> = <var>a</var> ?? <var>b</var>;</code> // "nullish coalescing operator" where a is not boolean; gives a if it's not null or undefined (so can give falsey a values like 0 or ""), and gives the default value b otherwise
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>NaN != NaN</code>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Here are some concepts I know that supplement this 
                    chapter: 
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code>+'5' + 1 === 6 //</code> plus sign as a unary operator explicitly coerces a string to a number, though it's not as complete as parseInt('5'), as +'5px' would instead yield NaN
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>!!'5' === true; !!{} === true; !!0 === false;</code> // double exclamation point as a unary operator explicitly coerces any value to a boolean
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>!'5' === false; !{} === false; !0 === true;</code> // single exclamation point as a unary operator explicitly converts any value to its opposite boolean
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>299_800_000</code> // yields 299800000; underscores can be added in any numeric literals to make them more readable
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Between these two lists, some of them are maybe not 
                    intended by the language, but they're all consistent 
                    enough to be used as outright features.

                    The devil's in the details.
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    I already knew everything that was in this chapter, or at 
                    least, I knew everything it intended for me to know. Of 
                    the (offhand-mentioned) list of reserved keywords, I 
                    haven't been using most of the object-oriented ones in my 
                    JavaScript. The keywords <code>async</code> and 
                    <code>await</code> are conspicuously missing from the 
                    chapter's list of keywords, and I don't think I've ever 
                    used the keywords <code>with</code> or <code>yield</code>. 
                    None of this is in the intended scope of the chapter, but 
                    if I'm brushing up on my JavaScript, I think it's good to 
                    look out for places where I can be thorough.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The <code>with</code> keyword is deprecated, but here's 
                    my first script using <code>yield</code>. The below 
                    elements generate a number between the lower & upper 
                    bounds, then stops generating after 10 yields, unless you 
                    change the bounds: 
                    <br />

                <p>
                    These chapters are getting longer now. There's a little 
                    quirk to be found in a chapter that instructs how to write 
                    sets of instructions, while part of that instruction is an 
                    example specifically about recursion.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The book doesn't specifically endorse one way or the 
                    other when it comes to creating functions, but I'm bought 
                    in on the arrow functions. I always thought that unless 
                    two functions must reference one another, it's bad form to 
                    use a function before it's defined in the code. So I 
                    didn't use this quirk of <code>function fun() {}</code> 
                    declaration notation and wound up forgetting about it. 
                    Plus, this notation never lets you define <code>fun</code> 
                    as a constant, and I always define functions as 
                    <code>const</code> whenever possible. <code>const fun = () 
                    => {}</code> is valid JavaScript, and <code>const function 
                    fun() {}</code> is not.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I should also note that I'd forgotten about default 
                    function inputs that replace undefined ones, where a 
                    function is defined <code>(a, b = 'default input') => 
                    {}</code> so that if a function call is missing an 
                    argument, it can fill <code>b</code> in with the 
                    assignment expression in the function arguments 
                    definition. 
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    This is the longest chapter in the book!
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    Sure enough, my ability with objects in JavaScript has 
                    been pretty under-utilized. In fact, I probably learned 
                    things in the wrong order the first time around, because I 
                    never use the <code>in</code> or <code>delete</code> 
                    keywords, because I didn't understand them when I first 
                    learned about them, because I wasn't using JavaScript 
                    objects until later on! So here's another list of things I 
                    haven't been using in my JavaScript:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code>for(const keyName in object) { ... }</code> // for-in loops iterate over the keys in an object 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>const obj = {a, b}</code> // gives the keys "a" and "b" to an object and assigns them the corresponding values 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>obj['2']; obj['two words']; {"two words": 2, "fun()": 'yay'}</code> // can assign object keys using otherwise invalid variable names, by using quotes 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>delete obj.a</code> // removes a key from an object 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>Object.assign(a, b, c, ...)</code> // merges objects, copying all properties from later objects into the first object 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>arr[-2]; arr['three']</code> // arrays can have any key because they're just objects; I think it's bad form, but it's good to know 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>arr.includes('somevalue', num)</code> // checks if an array has a given value at or above the index number num 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>'somekey' in obj</code> // returns a boolean representing whether some keyname is in the object 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>let array2 = array1.slice()</code> // slice an array without arguments to just return a new independent copy of the array
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>str.padStart(8, "0")</code> // pads a string; if this string is not 8 characters long, leading 0s are added until it is
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>arr.join(' - ')</code> // joins all elements of an array into a single string, with the argument being added between each entry; [1, 2, 3] -> 1 - 2 - 3
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>let array2 = ['a', ...array1, 'z']</code> // puts all elements from array1 into array2, between the 'a' and 'z' values
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>([a, b, c, d]) => {...}</code> // assigns values from an input array to the values of the variables a, b, c, and d; more wieldy than just using the array
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>JSON.stringify({}); JSON.parse(someJsonString);</code> // converts to and from JSON strings, largely for API calls
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>arr?.[0]; obj?.fun?.()</code> // the winking elvis operator's notation for arrays & function calls
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>n => ({prop: n})</code> // shorthand for an arrow function that returns an object; parentheses keep object from being interpreted as a function body
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    In spite of the increasing verbosity of the chapters, I 
                    know some things would remain a complete mystery for an 
                    actual beginner reading this book. In the "Destructuring" 
                    section, it says you can use square brackets to "look 
                    inside" of an array value to bind its contents, but it 
                    doesn't give an example, making this a nearly 
                    indecipherable remark if you don't see an example 
                    (<code>let [a, b, c, d] = someArrayWith4Elements</code>).
                </p>

                <p>
                    The chapter had a bit of math, too, which is cool. It 
                    sometimes takes lots of math & working out general 
                    formulas to make my scripts act the way I want them to, so 
                    seeing someone else using math as part of their process is 
                    refreshing. That's surprisingly uncommon for what 
                    programming fundamentally is.
                </p>

                    Yo, dawg, I heard you like functions.
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    Well, I looked ahead and saw that chaper 4 was the longest 
                    chapter in the entire book. This chapter was significantly 
                    shorter, though it also covers inbuilt language specifics 
                    that are wheels I've tended to reinvent rather than using 
                    their implementations that are available by default. 
                    Hopefully by having run by these here, I'll have better 
                    recall when it comes time to use them:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code>filteredArray = array.filter(item => { return boolean; })</code> // array function to filter out items that return falsey when passed to the given function
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>mappedArray = array.map(item => { return doStuff(item); })</code> // array function to process each item into a value derived from that item, then return those derived values in an array
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>value = array.reduce((item1, item2) => { return combinedItem; }, startItem?)</code> // array function that combines the first value with each subsequent value, using the combining function, iteratively until they're all combined, returning the combination
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>array.some(arg => { return boolean; })</code> // array function returning true if ANY of its values return truthy when passed into the given function
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>array.find( item => { return boolean; } )</code> // array function finding the first element that returns true when it's passed to the given function
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>(a, {b}) => { ... }</code> // asserts that b is a property of an object and uses that property by its value when it's in the function
                    </li>

                <p>
                    There's something so arcane about the Symbol type. When a 
                    Symbol is instantiated, I imagine a unique glyph appearing 
                    and being used as the label for whatever property it 
                    corresponds to.

                    I already knew about maps, the "extends" & "static" & 
                    "super" keywords work like in Java. The syntax is similar, 
                    but you can tell that all things about JavaScript classes 
                    are syntactic construct made by composing objects & 
                    functions such that they can look & act like Java classes, 
                    with the syntax hiding all of the complexity required for 
                    that underneath. It's not a fundamental of the language 
                    like it is in Java; it's a bunch of other concepts all 
                    coming together to make this, which makes it harder to 
                    wrap your head around, despite the code itself being 
                    mostly familiar.

                    About the only debugging feature I've used in JavaScript 
                    was exception handling & console logging, so this is 
                    mostly new territory for me. Here are some features to 
                    keep a note of from this chapter:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code>"use strict";</code> // can be used as the first line in a script or function description to enable <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode" target="_blank">strict mode</a>, throwing errors to help debug code

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <code>function fun() { "use strict"; i = 10; console.log(i) };</code>// keeps undeclared function variables from silently being declared in the global scope
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <code>"use strict"; function fun(property) { this.property = property };</code> // keeps function variables from binding "this" to the global scope whenever the functions aren't used as methods
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <code>"use strict"; with</code> // keeps from using "with" statements

                            <li>
                                <code>"ust strict"; function fun(a, b, a) {};</code> // keeps a function from getting multiple parameters with the same name

                    <li>
                        <code>debugger;</code> // sets a break point in the program; in a debug-enabled environment (like the browser's F12 developer tools), this pauses the program and allows you to inspect the values of variable bindings at that point
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>try { ... } finally { ... }</code> // a finally block does not stop an exception from propagating; it runs, then the exception continues up the call stack until caught

                        <code>if(thing.happens) throw new Error("thing happened");</code> // this is an "assertion" construct, asserting that something doesn't happen, by throwing an exception if it DOES happen

                    <li>
                        <code>const thing = new class { ... }</code> // creates an instance of an anonymous class

                <p>
                    It's a one-line solution for otherwise many-line problems. 
                    Sure, it's general-use code and has the common pitfalls 
                    when compared against purpose-built code where it's 
                    applicable, but it wraps a LOT of functionality into a 
                    relatively tiny package.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Here's a long list of concepts for regular expressions in 
                    JavaScript, enough to take me from zero to practical:

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <code>new Regexp("abc"); /abc/;</code> // these represent the same expression; they mean "a" followed by "b" followed by "c"
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>/A\+\/\/;</code> // backslashes must still be used to represent special character codes, plus a few other ones like /, +, and ?, and are not escaped to represent the backslash character (/\/ instead of /\\/ means single backslash "\")
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>/abc/.test(string);</code> // tests whether the given string contains a match of the regular expression pattern
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>/abc/.test(string); string.contains('abc');</code> // regex is a slower-running solution for simple tasks like this
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>/[0123456789]/; /[0-9]/;</code> // both match to all strings that contain a digit
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>/[a-z]/</code> // square brackets with a hyphen in the middle represent the whole range of characters between those characters, inclusive; for this, character values are their unicode values
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>/[0a-z]/</code> // square brackets can be thought of as a "one of" block, where it's one of the characters in the brackets; this one represents one of either: 0 or a through z
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            // some special shortcuts

                            <ul>
                                <li>

                                </li>
                                <li>

                <p>
                    It's just imports & exports, how they work, and how to 
                    leverage that for JavaScript software design. Here are the 
                    chapter's concepts about ECMAscript / ES modules, plus a 
                    little extra that's helpful for my learning context:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        // using either "export" or "import" in a script turns it into a module
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>export const myBinding = ...</code> // anything marked as "export" becomes visible to other modules; can be any classes or functions or objects or primitives, anything that can be named can be exported
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        // exports can only be made from the global context of the script; nothing can be exported directly from within a function or class or other block
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        // the set of exports in a module are collectively called the "interface" of that module
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>import {myBinding, myOtherBinding} from "./my-bindings.js";</code> // "import" can be used within scripts to access any of the specified bindings from an exporting module; those bindings must be marked as "export" in the module being exported from
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        // the above means that anything not marked as "export" is not visible to any outside module
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        // the set of imports in a module are collectively called the "dependencies" of that module
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>import {myBinding as myVar} from "./my-bindings.js";</code> // can rename an imported binding upon its import; this importing module will use "myVar" in place of "myBinding" to refer to that binding
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        // the above is especially important for managing the namespace, as it allows the use of bindings that might otherwise be incompatible because they share a name
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>export default ['a', 1, true]</code> // export default can only be defined once in a module, it can be nameless within the module, and it's usually used in modules that only have a single export
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>import myArray from "./my-bindings.js"</code> // default exports can be imported without brackets and named by the importing module
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>import * as bindingsObj from "./my-bindings.js"; bindings.myArray</code> // "import *" means the import name becomes an object that holds all the exports from the exporting module
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>&lt;script type="module"&gt;</code> // type="module" is required to use modules with inline scripts on an HTML page
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>import {parse} from "ini";</code> // module addresses can be plain names (like "ini") when managed by NPM node package manager
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        // a distributable collection of code is termed a "package," and NPM is a standard distribution system for JavaScript packeges; see <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/" target="_blank">the NPM website</a> for information about creating, distributing, and utilizing packages
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    As imports & exports were only implemented well after 
                    JavaScript was a standard in programming, a common 
                    proto-module system agreed upon by developers was 
                    CommonJS, which uses a "require" function and "exports" 
                    object to modularize JavaScript dependencies:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code>const ordinal = require("ordinal"); const {days, months} = require("date-names");</code> // "require" is implemented by a CommonJS module to return bindings that provide the module's functionality
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>exports.formatDate = function(date) { return `${days[date.getDay()]}, ${months[date.getMonth()]} ${ordinal(date.getDate())}, ${date.getFullYear()}`; };</code> // all of the bindings that came from "requires" above can be used to define properties for the current script's "exports" object
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>const {formatDate} = require("format-date.js"); formatDate(new Date(2017, 9, 13));</code> // yet another file can then find & use the formatDate binding, using the requires function to import it
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        // NPM provides management & interoperability between CommonJS and ES modules, but writing new CommonJS is NOT recommended; it's no longer standard and can be harder to understand, but it's better to have at least this much knowledge so as to not be blindsided when it's encountered
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    And here are some other pointers from the chapter:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code>let fun = Function('a, b', 'return a + b;');</code> // the "Function" function allows strings to be read as code; the first argument is the list of arguments for the function being defined, and the second argument is the function body that goes between the brackets
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>let answer = eval('(a, b) => { return a + b }');</code> // a more powerful binding than Function, "eval" parses ANY string passed to it as JavaScript code
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        // transpilers or compilers -- converters that parse other coding styles & dialects (like TypeScript) into browser-readable JavaScript (or even to past versions of JavaScript, for backwards compatibility)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        // bundlers -- converters that merge all the code from a module's dependencies into a single large file, as fetching a single large file generally has MUCH better performance than fetching many smaller files from many different sources
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        // minifiers -- converters that reduce the file size of a script by removing comments & renaming bindings into (often illegible but) short names like "a" and "_"
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        // for the above 3 types of converter tools, this is post-processing done with one's code, and you still want to keep the raw code, as written, for development & maintenance purposes, while the converted version is used by the live run environment
                    </li>
                </ul>

                            <p>
                                This is a design brainstorming exercise rather 
                                than a coding exercise.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The top-level functionality of this program is 
                                provided by <code>runRobot</code>, so the 
                                modular structure of the program should have 
                                <code>runRobot</code> be the top-level 
                                interface to build the program around, as a 
                                <code>default export</code> from 
                                a <code>"robot"</code> file.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                One would also need arguments to give to the 
                                <code>runRobot</code> function, which includes 
                                a <code>VillageState</code>, a 
                                <code>robot</code> function that returns an 
                                object containing its next move (in a 
                                "<code>direction</code>" property) & an 
                                arbitrary value as its <code>memory</code>, 
                                and that same arbitrary value would be passed 
                                in to the robot function as its third 
                                argument. Because the 
                                <code>VillageState</code> doesn't have the 
                                most apparent format for a developer to create 
                                one themselves, it should be able to be 
                                generated by an in-package function. That 
                                function may take in arguments to define 
                                specifics of a village state, but for the 
                                scope of the project, it can simply return the 
                                output of <code>VillageState.random()</code>. 
                                Such a function and its requirements 
                                (including the <code>VillageState</code> class 
                                itself) can be included in a 
                                <code>"village"</code> file. That function 
                                returning the output of 
                                <code>VillageState.random()</code> would be 
                                the <code>default export</code>, I would 
                                modify <code>VillageState</code> to include 
                                its <code>roadGraph</code> among its object 
                                properties, and the <code>roadGraph</code> can 
                                be generated using <code>buildGraph</code> and 
                                injected through a slightly extended 
                                <code>VillageState</code> constructor.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Due to the above, <code>buildGraph</code> may 
                                be separated into a module and its output used 
                                as the default argument for the 
                                <code>"village" default export</code> 
                                function, so that it may also be 
                                custom-defined by a developer wanting their 
                                own custom village map.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The <code>robot</code> argument to the 
                                <code>"robot" default export</code> function 
                                doesn't make itself apparent, so it may define 
                                <code>randomRobot</code> as a default input 
                                and have that along with 
                                <code>goalOrientedRobot</code> added to 
                                another <code>"sample-robots"</code> module, 
                                including any of their dependencies.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Routing operations like <code>findRoute</code> 
                                may be executed with something like 
                                <code>"dijskstrajs"</code> from NPM and 
                                interacted with through a translated version 
                                of the <code>roadGraph</code> that's now in 
                                the <code>VillageState</code>. For this, 
                                <code>"village"</code> may also be a 
                                dependency to the <code>"sample-robots"</code> 
                                module.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Sample usage of the <code>"robot"</code> 
                                module should be documented in that module, 
                                and with the prescribed dependency structure, 
                                using it just within the scope of its project 
                                should be straightforwardly simple.

                                Exercise 10.3 - Circular Dependencies
                            </summary>

                            <p>
                                This is a brainstorming exercise rather than a 
                                coding exercise.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Circular dependencies in CommonJS can work 
                                through the base script, the one defining 
                                <code>require</code>, wrapping CommonJS 
                                modules into functions and using exception 
                                handling to determine if that function is 
                                unable to run due to an unfulfilled 
                                dependency.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                It may ultimately resolve circular 
                                dependencies by concatenating them and 
                                defining their contents through the 
                                <code>function</code> initializer so that the 
                                code that appears earlier in the concatenation 
                                can reference code that appears later, and 
                                vice-versa.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                To determine which dependency to concatenate, 
                                the exception message may be cross-referenced 
                                with the <code>require()</code> arguments in 
                                the module, determined through regex, then 
                                that dependency can be sought, determined if 
                                circular (again through determining its 
                                <code>require()</code> args), and if it isn't 
                                circular, resolve that dependency before 
                                resolving this one. If it IS circular, then go 
                                ahead & concatenate before resolving the 
                                concatenated dependencies together.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Because this allows the cache to populate all 
                                modules before a CommonJS module calls 
                                <code>require()</code>, the in-module call to 
                                <code>require()</code> will be calling a 
                                pre-loaded known dependency in either 
                                dependency direction.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                That may not be how it DOES work, but that may 
                                be how it COULD work.

                    I sort of understand Promises, await, and callback 
                    functions going into this, enough that I actually use them 
                    in my coding, but going by the depth of the last chapters, 
                    I'm up for some new surprises. And I know enough to know 
                    that Promises & async await deserve their own sections in 
                    my notes...

                        <code>for(let value of generator(1)) { ... }</code> // the yields from a generator function can be treated as an iterator; the generator RETURNS a custom iterator, whose next value is the next yield of the function

                        <code>MyClass.prototype[Symbol.iterator] = function*() { ... };</code> // a generator function can be attached as a method to a Symbol.iterator binding in a class, to quickly turn that class into an iterable

                        // async functions can be thought of as a type of generator that produces a Promise when called and resolves on return or rejects on throw; it suspends execution during an await, which either resolves to a value or throws an exception before resuming the async function

                    <li>
                        // asynchronous code runs on its own call stack, not on the main thread; keeps exceptions thrown in them from ever reaching a catch statement outside of a Promise or async function

                <p>
                    ASYNC FUNCTIONS RETURN PROMISES. That's a big thing to not 
                    forget, because an async function is a easier to interpret 
                    than the Promise constructor

                <p>
                    I'd call this one a more proper textbook project, since it 
                    mostly just uses knowledge from earlier in the book. There 
                    are some other JavaScript Error types this uses, like 
                    <code>SyntaxError</code> and <code>TypeError</code>, but 
                    other than that, it's almost all an application of 
                    previous concepts, sprinkled in with some theory.

                    This chapter introduces syntax trees, parsers, 
                    interpreters, and compilation, all in terms of the work 
                    that's done in this chapter. The parser turns the raw code 
                    into a syntax tree, the evaluator executes the code 
                    defined by the syntax tree, and that all adds up to an 
                    interpreter for the "Egg" language built in this chapter. 
                    Lastly, compilation is taking it a step further and 
                    preprocessing the executable code into a further optimized 
                    version of the interpreted code, frontloading as much of 
                    that processing as possible and outputting a compiled 
                    version of the code that runs faster than the language 
                    just being interpreted. For example, code in the Egg 
                    language from this chapter might compile into JavaScript, 
                    and instead of running the Egg code directly, you would 
                    compile it into JavaScript code and then run that 
                    JavaScript code instead of the Egg interpreter.

                                The JavaScript-language function represented 
                                by the Egg-language function runs a recursive 
                                sub-evaluation that passes local-scope 
                                bindings to its arguments in place of the 
                                program's higher scope. This higher scope is 
                                the prototype of the local scope by way of any 
                                higher scopes (including that from other 
                                functions!) being passed in as the second 
                                argument to the "fun" special form definition 
                                before being used as the prototype of the 
                                function's local scope through the local scope 
                                effectively being defined by 
                                <code>Object.create(higherScope)</code>. This 
                                makes a function's scope visible to all of its 
                                embedded functions, as well as functions 
                                embedded in those sub-functions, recursively.

                    Back in familiar territory again...
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    This chapter is a bit of background info on the Internet & 
                    how we get from zero to JavaScript. If I was formally 
                    educated in computer science, I'd probably know all about 
                    TCP/IP and the distinction between the World Wide Web and 
                    the Internet. I knew about communication protocols from my 
                    time with industrial controllers & IoT, protocols like 
                    Modbus and DeviceNet and OPC/UA. They're just languages 
                    that machines speak, and as long as both machines speak 
                    that language, they can communicate meaningfully with each 
                    other. HTTP is a structured request-and-reply resource 
                    exchange protocol / language, and it happens over TCP, 
                    which is a listen-and-connect protocol / language that 
                    manages routing to listening ports. The World Wide Web is 
                    the set of these standards & languages, with the "Web" 
                    referring to the interconnections between many devices. A 
                    URL points to a protocol ("https://"), a server address / 
                    domain name to send a request to via that protocol 
                    ("nickhz.live/"), and a path to a specific resource within 
                    that server to request 
                    ("professional/self-development/eloquent-javascript-2024/index.html").
                </p>

                <p>
                    After that, it's HTML & embedding scripts. The character 
                    entities like <code>&amp;gt;</code> and 
                    <code>&amp;amp;</code> are mentioned, 
                    <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/named-characters.html" target="_blank">of 
                    which there are many more</a>, but 
                    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Character_reference" target="_blank">a 
                    small subset of character entities</a> is generally 
                    sufficient to meet the needs of an HTML document. The 
                    general HTML syntax & embedding JavaScript is demonstrated 
                    by this Web page. If this chapter had any exercises, this 
                    page would be sufficient to fulfill them. Press F12!

                <p>
                    Event listeners, event handlers, event types, a bit of 
                    event bubbling (though the text doesn't use that word 
                    specifically), all stuff that I generally know but has 
                    some extra detail that I want written down. Not all of 
                    this is in the text, but reading the text did make me 
                    think of including all the things that are here:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code>event.type</code> // holds whether an Event object is a "click" or a "mousedown" or a "keyup" etc.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>event.stopPropagation()</code> // keeps an event from bubbling or capturing into the event handlers of parents or children
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>aDivWithButtonsInside.addEventListener('click', () => { event.target === aButtonInsideTheDiv })</code> // registering an event handler on a parent will pass in events whose event.target identifies a child that the event propagates from
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>event.preventDefault()</code> // used in an event handler, this prevents the event's default behavior, like changing the page on an &lt;a&gt; tag click or scrolling the page downward when the down arrow is pressed
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>if(event.ctrlKey && event.altKey && event.key == " ") ...</code> // an event holds information about whether shiftKey, ctrlKey, altKey, or metaKey was being pressed when the event was created
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>&lt;div tabindex&gt;</code> // the tabindex attribute allows an element to be focused by keyboard navigation, like links and inputs can be by default
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>event.type === 'input'; activeElement.value</code> // input events are said to be best for handling changes to input & textarea fields, and referencing their content is to be done with the dynamic activeElement property of the document
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>event.type === 'click'</code> // DETAIL: the click event fires after the mouseup event, on the most specific element that contained both the press and release of the mouse button
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>event.type === 'dblclick'</code> // DETAIL: the dblcick event fires AFTER THE SECOND CLICKEVENT
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>mouseEvent.clientX; mouseEvent.clientY;</code> // for mouse events, a "client" dimensional property is the px coordinate relative to the upper left of the viewport

                    <li>
                        <code>mouseEvent.pageX; mouseEvent.pageY;</code> // for mouse events, a "page" dimensional property is the px coordinate relative to the upper left of the entire document

                    <li>
                        <code>event.type === 'mousemove'; event.buttons</code> // mousemove events keep a binary identifier of buttons currently being pressed; LMB is +1, RMB is +2, and MMB is +4
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>event.type === 'touchstart'; event.type === 'touchmove'; event.type === 'touchend'</code> // TOUCH EVENTS ALSO FIRE MOUSE EVENTS AFTERWARD; can use preventDefault() to keep the mouse event from firing
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>touchEvent.touches[0]</code> // a touch event has an array-like "touches" property, the elements of which hold the clientX, clientY, pageX, and pageY properties for each touch
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>event.type === 'scroll'; event.preventDefault()</code> // scroll events happen AFTER the page has already scrolled, so page scrolling is not prevented by preventDefault()
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>innerHeight; innerWidth;</code> // dynamic window properties that give the dimensions of the viewport

                    It all feels so disconnected until it all comes together. 
                    I think it would be better presented as one big long 
                    script that can be used as a reference during the reading, 
                    or even better: emphasize that the reader should write out 
                    this program in order to understand it best. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    At least for me, seeing the program all in one place is 
                    more readable than seeing little bits of it interspersed 
                    throughout the chapter. It makes all the arguments sent to 
                    the functions less cryptic. I guess there's a meta-lesson 
                    there, about the risks of over-modularization, but 
                    learning the lesson in real time by having to reference 
                    other parts of the page for each line of code made the 
                    exercises probably more painful than they needed to be. 
                    Albeit, over time spent with custom library-like code like 
                    this, you get used to the names & abstractions & structure 
                    of it, just not if it's a library that's only relevant for 
                    one chapter in a textbook. You just don't spend enough 
                    time with it to really know it holistically before you 
                    have to work with it, and it's like working with an alien 
                    toolbox. But we soldier on.

                    Chapter 17 - Drawing on Canvas
                </summary>

                <blockquote>
                    This one might be the most exciting chapter for me! The 
                    browser yields many under-explored artforms. Up to this 
                    point, have I been drawing without a canvas?
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    I've had my eyes on SVG & canvas. The book doesn't go much 
                    into SVG, which is understandable since JavaScript isn't a 
                    requirement for its use. Canvas is the mainstay, but 
                    there's enough covered to think that one chapter in a 
                    textbook is more of just an introduction than anything 
                    else. It's a welcome one, since one of the troubles with 
                    learning Canvas is having an idea of where to start, but 
                    now that I've peeked at the 
                    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D" target="_blank">Canvas 
                    2d context API</a>, I realize that this chapter actually 
                    covers a significant chunk of what it can do. Its power 
                    comes from getting creative with the toolset, which I 
                    thought would've been bigger for all that it's capable of. 
                    But it really goes to show how effective this chapter is 
                    at throwing you into canvas concepts.

                    After this, I'm more confident in exploring the other 
                    powerful browser rendering techs instead of just 
                    defaulting to DHTML & CSS3 for artistic Web pages. And 
                    there are some visual effects I've seen that are suddenly 
                    a lot less mysterious now. Maybe I'll be making mysteries 
                    for those after me to ponder, too!

                                and preload the transform by applying it to 
                                that instead.

                    I think that starting with the actual text of the protocol 
                    communications is a great way to start when teaching 
                    fetch. A lot of confusion can be avoided with a concrete 
                    grounding like this, demystifying what lies beneath what's 
                    being taught.

                <blockquote>
                    Redux?
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    This is the last of the browser JavaScript chapters. The 
                    project structure here echoes a React application with 
                    the component-based structure & state management, and I 
                    don't think that's an accident. Looking back at previous 
                    editions, then sure enough, this structure only came about 
                    when React hit the author's lips. I can appreciate the 
                    thoughtfulness of directing the skill in a way that's 
                    marketable. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    That said, I believe that knowledge of plain JavaScript, 
                    like from this book, will get a lot more mileage than 
                    knowledge of any particular UI library or framework that's 
                    built on top of JavaScript. Over the course of this book, 
                    I've learned more about all the frontend frameworks at 
                    once. It's fine enough to see how a stateful frontend 
                    application is structured without so many layers of 
                    abstraction, but I put this architecture firmly in the 
                    category of being a preference or tool rather than being 
                    the one right way to do things. It's a single methodology 
                    out of the many that can be composed with this knowledge.

                                exercise than was intended by the textbook. 
                                It's a locally-running Node.js web app that 
                                provides a UI for full file-system control 
                                within a specified folder, including subfolder 
                                & file creation, file uploads, file & folder 
                                deletion, a visual structure that matches the 
                                directory structure, sandboxing against the 
                                application deleting or overwriting itself or 
                                any files that weren't sent through the 
                                application, automatically generated links to 
                                files that are added, and a UI that 
                                dynamically updates in response to changes 
                                made in the file system by the user.

                <blockquote>
                    The final stretch!
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    This bit was essentially a meta-exercise in interpreting a 
                    front & backend project that's already pre-written. That's 
                    an important professional skill to have, sure, but I also 
                    appreciate it as victory lap for the reader to be able to 
                    say, "yes, I know JavaScript."
                </p>

                <p>
                    This chapter's entire project is somewhat less complicated 
                    than the one I wrote for chapter 20's final exercise, but 
                    that's at least partly because it offloads much of the 
                    complexity with its structure and its dependencies. I 
                    might have skill, but the author Marijn has skill AND 
                    experience.
                </p>

                <p>
                    They assert that creating UI elements using an element 
                    creation function that takes the tag name, tag attributes, 
                    and child elements has led to messy code, but I think it's 
                    pretty clean, so clean that it's easy to know how to make 
                    it cleaner. They've basically built the JSX that underlies 
                    React.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        // CommonJS modules imported through NPM can be implemented through the "import" clause instead of needing the "requires" function; this adds forward compatibility from CommonJS to ES modules
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>request.headers['if-none-match']</code> // ON SERVER-SIDE; Node stores request header keys as LOWERCASE values
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 500));</code> // putting this statement in an async function is a simple way to force it to wait
                    </li>
                </ul>

                                Exercise 21.1 - Disk Persistence
                            </summary>

                            <p>
                                This solution can be defined in a few parts:
                            </p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    I created a <code>save-data.json</code> 
                                    file in the <code>skillsharing</code> 
                                    directory and gave it only an empty object 
                                    as content:

                                    <pre>{}</pre>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    In <code>skillsharing_server.mjs</code>, I 
                                    added this import statement to the top:

                                    <pre>import {readFile, writeFile} from 'node:fs/promises';</pre>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    In <code>skillsharing_server.mjs</code>, I 
                                    replaced this code:

                                    <pre>new SkillShareServer({}).start(8000);
</pre>

                                    with this code:

                                    <pre>(async () => {
  const talks = JSON.parse(await readFile('save-data.json'));

  console.log(talks);

  new SkillShareServer(talks).start(8000);
})();
</pre>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    In <code>skillsharing_server.mjs</code>, I 
                                    added this line to the 
                                    <code>SkillShareServer.prototype.updated</code> 
                                    function:

                                    <pre>writeFile('save-data.json', JSON.stringify(this.talks)).catch(err => { console.log('Couldn\'t write to file!'); console.log(String(err)); });</pre>
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>
                                With this, the application now reads from a 
                                save file upon starting, and it writes to that 
                                save file every time there's an update from a 
                                user. This preserving the application contents 
                                after crashes & restarts, fulfilling the 
                                feature requested by this exercise.

                                Exercise 21.2 - Comment Field Resets
                            </summary>

                            <p>
                                All of the changes I made for this exercise 
                                are in the <code>renderTalk()</code> function 
                                defined in 
                                <code>public/skillsharing_client.js</code>:
                            </p>

                            <pre>let thisClientSubmitted = false;
function renderTalk(talk, dispatch) {
  const commentAttributes = {type: "text", name: "comment", oninput: event => { 
    localStorage.setItem('commentInProgressTalk', talk.title);
    localStorage.setItem('commentInProgressContent', event.target.value);
  }};

  if(talk.title === localStorage.getItem('commentInProgressTalk') && thisClientSubmitted === false) {
    commentAttributes.value = localStorage.getItem('commentInProgressContent');
  }
  thisClientSubmitted = false;

  const commentElement = elt("input", commentAttributes);

  const submitCommentButton = elt("button", {type: "submit", onclick: event => {
    thisClientSubmitted = true;
  }}, "Add comment");

  return elt(
    "section", {className: "talk"},
    elt("h2", null, talk.title, " ", elt("button", {
      type: "button",
      onclick() {
        dispatch({type: "deleteTalk", talk: talk.title});
      }
    }, "Delete")),
    elt("div", null, "by ",
        elt("strong", null, talk.presenter)),
    elt("p", null, talk.summary),
    ...talk.comments.map(renderComment),
    elt("form", {
      onsubmit(event) {
        event.preventDefault();
        let form = event.target;
        dispatch({type: "newComment",
                  talk: talk.title,
                  message: form.elements.comment.value});
        form.reset();
      }
    }, commentElement, " ",
       submitCommentButton));
}
</pre>

                            <p>
                                With this, the content & location of a comment 
                                in progress is saved to local storage, and if 
                                that location is encountered when the page 
                                re-renders, it restores that comment from 
                                local storage to the client's comment box. 
                                Because it uses local storage, it's also 
                                refresh-safe.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Additionally, because local storage is shared 
                                when two clients are on one system, the UI tracks 
                                whether a comment was submitted from that 
                                particular client, rescinding the content of the 
                                comment box only whenever the comment was 
                                submitted by this client. This lets the comment 
                                box continue to empty itself upon submit.
                            </p>

                    I would recommend this book to others who want to learn 
                    JavaScript. I still believe I was fairly capable with 
                    browser JS from the beginning, but now, it feels like I've 
                    completed a toolbox that I didn't even know was 
                    incomplete! It's handed me a lot of leads for moving 
                    forward with, too. I think the intended route here is 
                    React, but I'm also interested in websockets and SVG. It's 
                    made several concepts like canvas & asynchronous code more 
                    approachable, too.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Because JavaScript is supported by the ecosystems built on 
                    it, the more complete knowledge of the pure language can 
                    feel like having all the cheat codes. I can imagine how 
                    more things must work behind the scenes now, like how JSX 
                    could be implemented similarly to how the Egg programming 
                    language from chapter 12 was, or how React & Angular 
                    components are essentially just the stateful class 
                    components created in the final chapter & handled as ES 
                    modules, with the syntactic sugar of JSX added to them. I 
                    can see through things that were once arcane, and it's 
                    thanks to the understanding from this book.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The application from the final chapter was a logical 
                    conclusion, a webapp whose UI doesn't even render without 
                    the browser running a mess of JavaScript. The mainstream 
                    Web UI frameworks have reached similar conclusions before, 
                    too, and I personally don't agree with it. There are 
                    performance reasons & bad-practice reasons & probably 
                    environmental reasons that can support me on that, but my 
                    personal core for being against it is that JavaScript 
                    should be reserved for the good stuff. It's the ace in the 
                    hole for making the impossible possible in Web UI, and 
                    when you make it handle every menial little task on the 
                    browser, what's happened is that you spread its capability 
                    thin in the developer's mind and wind up underselling what 
                    JavaScript is truly capable of. It's powerful, and there's 
                    less & less thought about that power as people abstract it 
                    away into Web frameworks that regularly try to put it in 
                    your head that you need an entire JavaScript framework for 
                    an interactive application. I don't need a single line of 
                    JavaScript for 
                    <a href="../../../wip/" target="_blank">basic functions 
                    like single-url pagination or motion graphics 
                    rendering</a> to work. The frameworks make applications 
                    that are maintainable & easy to collaborate on. They're 
                    tools that help the bottom line for larger teams, not a 
                    statement on the one right way to do things. Converging on 
                    it as if it IS the one right way to do things is probably 
                    getting at least a little caught up in the current trends, 
                    but as it's also being taught as a professional skill to 
                    help people get further along in the actual software 
                    industry, I think that part of it is commendable.

                    The last project did feel more like a victory lap than 
                    anything, and it makes me glad that I overcomplicated the 
                    final exercise from chapter 20, rebuilding that from 
                    scratch & adding my own new features instead of sticking 
                    strictly to the book. It gave me the chance to compose 
                    everything from the whole text together into a program 
                    that's truly my own, where I took it as a problem 
                    statement to create a solution for rather than as a 
                    LeetCode-esque exercise to figure out an abstract 
                    algorithm. I now have an extensible application that works 
                    as my own custom & quickly searchable file manager, and 
                    it's thanks to the application requested by this book. 
                    With some polish, it can even become something you can 
                    sell to people, and that crosses a line from being a 
                    textbook exercise to being a peek into the vision of an 
                    engineer, the vision of the one who wrote this book.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I have my own visions, too: problems to solve and 
                    solutions to be made. And with this book now behind me, 
                    I'm definitively better prepared for that future.

            I did little Leetcode Java during this, too, just as sanity checks 
            to make sure I don't lose that as I regain JavaScript specifics 
            that are similar-sounding. If switching back & forth between 
            those two, it might be easy to get wires crossed between my mental 
            models of their coding patterns.

            Here's a Java solution I noodled out for Leetcode problem 139 in 
            a couple of minutes:

            public boolean wordBreak(String s, List<String> wordDict) {
                for(int i = 0; i < wordDict.size(); i++) {
                    if(wordBreaks(s, wordDict.get(i), wordDict)) {
                        return true;
                    }
                }
                
                return false;
            }

            public boolean wordBreaks(String s, String dictionaryWord, List<String> wordDict) {
                return s.startsWith(dictionaryWord) && subWordBreaks(s.substring(dictionaryWord.length()), wordDict);
            }

            public boolean subWordBreaks(String subWord, List<String> wordDict) {
                return subWord.length() == 0 || wordBreak(subWord, wordDict);
            }

            Sanity checked.
